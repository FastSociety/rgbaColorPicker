# rgbaColorPicker

### Usage
To use the rgbaColor Picker you'll need to include a version of jQuery (tested with 1.6.4, although older version should be fine), the rgbacolorpicker.js file, and either include the rgbacolorpicker.css file, or add the styles from it into an already included css file. To create a color picker make an input and give it the class "rgbacolorpicker", the script will do the rest.

### Outputs
The script will output colors in the following order; Name, Hex, rgba.
