### Usage
At it's current state this you simply need to include the script, modified verion of tinycolor, stylesheet (with images in the same directory), and jQuery (lowest required version has not been determined, but works fine with 1.6) then create inputs with the class "rgbapicker". The script will replace the inputs with color pickers, preserving input names in the process.
